# Spot Consolidation

## Problem Statement

Customers face increased costs due to underutilized spot nodes. A customer with 4 x 24cpu pods would launch a 24xl (96cpu) instance type. If three of the four pods complete, the node will indefinitely run at 25% reservation until the pod completes, is able to fit elsewhere in the cluster, or additional work is scheduled to the node. Karpenter can currently "consolidate delete", by moving the pods to another node if capacity is available, but does not "consolidate replace", by launching a smaller replacement node for an undertuilized node. Customers have raised this inefficiency as a critical pain point with Karpenter: https://github.com/aws/karpenter-core/issues/763. 

Karpenter‚Äôs consolidation algorithm minimizes the price of EC2 instances given pod scheduling constraints. However, price minimization presents challenges for EC2 Spot, which offers a tradeoff between price and interruption rate. Karpenter uses EC2 Spot‚Äôs PriceCapacityOptimized (PCO) allocation strategy to provide a balanced approach to this tradeoff, and doesn't always select the cheapest instance type, since it may result in immediate interruption. If Karpenter were to consolidate spot capacity based purely on cost, it would repeatedly interrupt the same instance, walking down the PCO decision ladder, until only the lowest price remained. Because of these complications, Karpenter does not currently support "spot replacement" consolidation.

All consolidation actions contain an inherent tradeoff between price and availability. Ideally, we would like to define an algorithm that enables us to calculate some value that represents an instance type that fits our pods with price and availability optimized. Unfortunately, cloud providers don't surface capacity pool information (availability) for spot, meaning that we need to define availability by some heuristic to make this optimization work. This document explores approaches to enable consolidation for spot instances without regressing to lowest price.

## Design Options

### 1: Minimum Flexibility [Recommended] 

Karpenter will replace a spot node with a cheaper spot node for both single and multi-node consolidation. Cheaper spot instance types are selected with the `price-capacity-optimized` strategy and often the cheapest spot instance type is not launched due to the likelihood of interruption. Karpenter would replace spot node for single-node consolidation only if there are more than 15 potential replacement spot instance types. Also, Karpenter would have to limit its flexibility to this threshold while launching replacements with consolidation to avoid repeat interruptions, e.g. "walking down the ladder". Since on-demand capacity uses the lowest price strategy, its behavior is unaffected if these rules are applied equally to both spot and on-demand launches.

Minimum flexibility of 15 spot instance types is decided after an analysis done on the flexiblity of AWS customers request in the launch path. Karpenter does not have the same instance type flexibility requirement for multi-node spot-to-spot consolidations (many nodes to 1 node) since doing so without requiring flexibility won't lead to "race to the bottom" scenarios. It is also to prevent inconsistent behavior between consolidation of mixed capacity type [od,spot] to [spot] and spot capacity type [spot,spot] to [spot] since we already support mixed capacity type multi-node consolidation to spot today without any additional conditions.

Finally, a limit for the number of instance types in the launch path is placed only on consolidation instead of the entire launch path in the provisioning loop in order to unblock scenarios where a user doesn't have enough flexibility with spot specified in their NodePool. As a result, their initial launch would succeed but would get no consolidations after their initial launch.

Conceptually, this approach is straightforward to explain to customers and directly aligned with Spot best practices. Some customers may be disappointed by the flexibility requirement, but given the current lack of support for spot consolidation, it‚Äôs net positive from the status quo. While there may be valid use cases for customers to trade interruption rate for lower prices, we should delay enabling customers to configure this value until the use cases are better understood.

See appendix for examples.

* üëçüëçüëç Prevents consolidation from regressing to a lowest price allocation strategy
* üëç Easy to explain and implements spot best practices
* üëç Flexibility threshold is tunable, as best practices evolve. Cloud providers could choose to set it to 1 to disable this behavior.
* üëé Limits potential flexibility from status quo for instance replacement. Today, Karpenter can send unbounded flexibility to PCO (e.g. 100s of instance types).
* üëé Fails to take advantage of opportunities to migrate to healthier pools because we have limited the flexibility to 15 while launching replacements with single-node consolidation. If we had considered the entire set, we might have landed with a more available spot instance type that was outside of 15 spot instance types we listed.
* üëé Fails to consolidate to lower priced pools if the customer's request is less flexible because we would kick-off single-node consolidation only if there are at least 15 options cheaper than the current candidate and the current candidate is not in the set of the 15 cheapest instance types.

### 2. Price Improvement Factor

Karpenter could skip consolidation‚Äôs if the replacement instance types were only marginally better in price. For example, if replacing an m5a.large with an m5.large would only save 5%, it may not be worth the interruption. This behavior is valuable both for spot and on-demand instances, given the fact that consolidation is inherently an interruption. PIF must also constrain provisioning decisions, as without this, an instance could be provisioned by PCO, and then immediately consolidated. 

Given the cost of interrupting a workload, as well as the relatively short average lifetime of a workload, this value would need to be significant (e.g. 2x). Further analysis of the right default value function (constant, linear, polynomial) is needed, and given the difficulty of choosing this value, we should think carefully before enabling customers to configure it themselves.

This approach is predicated on customers configuring instance family flexibility, and relatively similar spot prices within a given size. For a customer flexible to all instance families within c,m,r categories, PCO would have a broad range of instance types to choose from, and would be unlikely to be forced to choose an unhealthy pool. This assumption follows EC2 spot best practices, and is relied upon by customers who use attribute-based selection with price protection.

For customers who rely on instance size flexibility within a single family, or lack sufficient flexibility, they may face increased interruption rates compared to options 1 and 2. Due to the natural price differences between different instance sizes within the same family, this approach would limit flexibility to one or two instances sizes, depending on current spot markets. However, having limited flexibility goes against spot best practices, and the customer should expect increased interruptions.

See appendix for examples.

* üëçüëç Limits consolidation from regressing to a lowest price allocation strategy
* üëç Extensible to new methods of capacity allocation, since Karpenter core is now completely agnostic to spot
* üëç Prevents consolidation from interrupting workloads for marginal improvement
* üëé During a spot capacity crunch, if many capacity pools within a price range are unhealthy, the customer may get interrupted soon after the consolidation. This is exacerbated if the customer cannot tolerate instance type diversity. 
* üëé Tuning this value to migitage both marginal-improvement-churn and lowest-price-regression is challenging, and desired values may conflict.

Note: Regardless of the decision made to solve the spot consolidation problem, we‚Äôd likely want to implement a price improvement in the future to prevent consolidation from interrupting nodes to make marginal improvements.

### 3. Optimistically Launch Replacements

Karpenter could optimistically launch new EC2 instances to probe PCO decision making. If PCO launches a cheaper instance type from a CreateInstanceFromTypes request that include the current instance type, we know that the instance is both lower price and lower interruption rate. If the PCO algorithm selects the current instance type of the running instance, Karpenter would terminate the new instance and leave the current instance running. This approach would need to include an optimistic launch cache to minimize the number of optimistic launches.

* üëçüëçüëç Prevents consolidation from regressing to a lowest price allocation strategy
* üëé May not make sense for all cloud providers
* üëé May consolidate to make marginal improvements, resulting in unnecessary disruption
* üëé Optimistic launches may confuse customers looking deeply at their bill or audit logs
* üëé Bugs with this mechanism are higher risk, and could impact cost/quotas, since real instances are being launched.

### 4. Minimum Node Lifetime

Karpenter could skip consolidation actions if the instance had been launched recently. This wouldn‚Äôt prevent the allocation strategy from regressing to lowest price, but given sufficient time (e.g. 4 hours), prevents the worst case scenario of repeated interruption.

There are multiple ways to model this time based constraint. Minimum node lifetime would prevent any consolidation of a node under a given age. Alternatively, this could be modeled as minimum pod lifetime, where consolidation would not terminate a node until all pods are above a specified age. This is the most direct approach to mitigate the problem statement: if there‚Äôs too much interruption, reduce frequency. We should delay (if ever) enabling customers from being able to configure this. 

Alternatively, we could rely on ttlSecondsAfterUnderutilized, where Karpenter would detect a potential consolidation and wait for the ttl before taking action. This is somewhat unnatural, since we‚Äôve seen customers configure the similar ttlSecondsAfterEmpty in the range of 30-180 seconds, which isn‚Äôt enough time to avoid regression to lowest price. It‚Äôs likely that customers would want one value (e.g. 30s) to handle empty nodes and another value to prevent repeated interruption (e.g. 4h). Further, given that we‚Äôre building consolidateAfter to meet other cases, customers would be required to reason about both minimum node lifetime and consolidateAfter. 

* üëç Avoids thrashing and delays regression to a lowest price allocations strategy
* üëé Eventually converges to a lowest price allocation strategy, which could increase interruptions
* üëé Consolidatable nodes may sit around for much longer than necessary
* üëé Increased complexity of additional controls that interact with other disruption behaviors

Note: Minimum node lifetime has other use cases, such minimizing disruption due to ‚Äúconsolidation delete‚Äú actions for recently scheduled pods. We may need to explore similar solutions to this problem in the future.

### Recommendation

Each of these approaches carries tradeoffs. It‚Äôs possible to layer multiple of these options for defense in depth against the problem. We could consider an iterative approach and drive these layers once we learn more from customer feedback.

Option 1 is straightforward to explain to customers and can be implemented easily. Options 2 and 4 layer naturally on top of it. It‚Äôs likely we‚Äôd want to do Option 2 regardless of whether or not Option 1 is a sufficient solution to this problem. It‚Äôs unlikely that we‚Äôd layer Option 3 with Option 1, as we wouldn‚Äôt need to limit flexibility if we optimistically launched capacity ‚Äî we‚Äôd simply know the correct answer. 

## Appendix

### 1. Minimum Flexibility Example

Multi-node consolidation for spot instances works the same as it does for on-demand instances today. So below example only targets single-node consolidation.

Assume we have instance types sorted in ascending price order I0, I1, ..., I500 and in this example our pods can always schedule on a node if its more expensive than the current one. This isn't realistic, but works for our example.

We have a set of pending pods and need to launch a spot node. The cheapest instance that would suffice is I50, so we send a CreateInstanceFromTypes request with the cheapest type that would work and the next 19 more expensive types that could also work I50, I51, ..., I69. We get back an I55 from PCO.

One pod exits, and now an I40 would work. We don't consolidate spot ‚Üí spot here since the set of candidates we might consolidate to (I40, I41, ... I59) already includes the current type, an I55. 

Another pod exits, and now an I30 would work. We consolidate spot ‚Üí spot and send a CreateInstanceFromTypes request for I30, I31, ..., I49.

### 2. Price Factor Example

#### 1. Replacing m5.xlarge w/  m5.* :

m5.xlarge spot price = $0.06
replacement price must be < $0.03
Candidates = 0
Closest Candidate = m5.large at $0.035

#### 2. Replacing m5.8xlarge w/  m5.* :

m5.8xlarge spot price = $0.565
replacement price must be <$0.283
Candidates = 4
 - m5.large ($0.035)
 - m5.xlarge ($0.06)
 - m5.2xlarge ($0.15)
 - m5.4xlarge ($0.24)
